# Coffee-Menu-Stack
This project is part of the Full-Stack Nanodegree program. With the follwing original description: Udacity has decided to open a new digitally enabled cafe for students to order drinks, socialize, and study hard. But they need help setting up their menu experience.

You have been called on to demonstrate your newly learned skills to create a full stack drink menu application. The application must:

Display graphics representing the ratios of ingredients in each drink.
Allow public users to view drink names and graphics.
Allow the shop baristas to see the recipe information.
Allow the shop managers to create new drinks and edit existing drinks.


## About the Stack
The full stack application is already done by Udacity. It is desiged with some key functional areas:

### Backend
The ./backend directory contains a partially completed Flask server with a pre-written SQLAlchemy module to simplify your data needs. I completed the required endpoints, configure, and integrate Auth0 for authentication.

View the README.md within ./backend for more details.

### Frontend
The ./frontend directory contains a complete Ionic frontend to consume the data from the Flask server. I updated the environment variables found within (./frontend/src/environment/environment.ts) to reflect the Auth0 configuration details set up for the backend app.

View the README.md within ./frontend for more details.
